# Example of aligning the first tick line with the start of the axis line in the Syncfusion Blazor Linear Gauge component

In this Blazor project, we created a sample that demonstrates how to reposition the first tick line with the start of the Linear Gauge's axis line.

In this example, we used the JavaScript method "**customizePath**" to determine the position of the tick line. To reposition the first major tick line with the start of the axis line, call this JavaScript method in the Linear Gauge's [Loaded](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeEvents.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeEvents_Loaded) event via a JavaScript interop method.
